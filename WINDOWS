### considerations

* cost of double vs triple
* energy use difference (ROI period?)
* air leakage
* emergency egress
    * minimum dimensions
        * 20" wide, 24" high
        * net clear opening 5.7 sq. ft
    * 44" max sill height
* intruder resistance
* picture windows seal best, followed by casement and awning
* high end vinyl windows are good, cheap / contractor grade vinyl usually isn't
* insulated fiberglass frame is most durable and least maintenance.

### definitions

* u-factor: lower u-factor = higher insulation, lower is better.
    * 0.30 is mediocre, less than 0.25 is good
* Solar Gain Heat Coefficient (0: blocks all solar heat gain, 1: passes all solar heat gain)
    * ~0.30 is typical, less is better in summer, worse in winter.
* South / West (sun facing) windows need low-e glass (SGHC closer to 0)
* Visible Transmittance: 0 to 1, higher is better.
* Air Leakage: 0 to 1, lower is better.
* Condensation resistance: 0 to 100, higher is better.
