### ENERGY STAR Certification Process

1. The certification process provides flexibility to select a custom combination of measures for each home that is equivalent in performance to the minimum requirements of the ENERGY STAR Reference Design Home, Exhibit 1, as assessed through energy modeling. Use a RESNET-accredited Home Energy Rating software program to determine the ENERGY STAR HERS Index Target, which is the highest numerical HERS Index value that each rated home may achieve to earn the ENERGY STAR. 8
2. Using the same software program, configure the preferred set of efficiency measures for the home to be certified and verify that the resulting HERS Index meets or exceeds the ENERGY STAR HERS Index Target, as determined in Step 1.
Note that, regardless of the measures selected, the Mandatory Requirements for All Certified Homes in Exhibit 2 are also required and impose certain constraints on the efficiency measures selected (e.g., insulation levels, insulation installation quality, window performance, duct leakage). Furthermore, on-site power generation may only be used to meet the ENERGY STAR HERS Index Target for homes that are larger than the Benchmark Home and only for the incremental change in the ENERGY STAR HERS Index Target caused by the Size Adjustment Factor. 9
3. Construct the home using the measures selected in Step 2 and the Mandatory Requirements for All Certified Homes, Exhibit 2.
4. Using a Rater, verify that all requirements have been met in accordance with the Mandatory Requirements for All Certified Homes and with RESNET’s On-Site Inspection Procedures for Minimum Rated Features. The Rater is required to keep electronic or hard copies of the completed and signed Rater checklists and the HVAC Design Report.
The Rater must review all items on the Rater checklists. Raters are expected to use their experience and discretion to verify that the overall intent of each inspection checklist item has been met (i.e., identifying major defects that undermine the intent of the checklist item versus identifying minor defects that the Rater may deem acceptable).
In the event that a Rater finds an item that is inconsistent with the intent of the checklists, the home cannot earn the ENERGY STAR until the item is corrected. If correction of the item is not possible, the home cannot earn the ENERGY STAR. In the event that an item on a Rater checklist cannot be inspected by the Rater, the home also cannot earn the ENERGY STAR. The only exceptions to this rule are in the Thermal Enclosure System Section of the Rater Field Checklist, where the builder may assume responsibility for verifying a maximum of eight items. This option shall only be used at the discretion of the Rater. When exercised, the builder’s responsibility will be formally acknowledged by the builder signing the checklist for the item(s) that they verified.
In the event that a Rater is not able to determine whether an item is consistent with the intent (e.g., an alternative method of meeting a checklist requirement has been proposed), then the Rater shall consult their Provider. If the Provider also cannot make this determination, then the Rater or Provider shall report the issue to EPA prior to project completion at: energystarhomes@energystar.gov and will typically receive an initial response within 5 business days. If EPA believes the current program requirements are sufficiently clear to determine whether the intent has been met, then this guidance will be provided to the partner and enforced beginning with the house in question. In contrast, if EPA believes the program requirements require revisions to make the intent clear, then this guidance will be provided to the partner but only enforced for homes permitted after a specified transition period after the release of the revised program requirements, typically 60 days in length.
This process will allow EPA to make formal policy decisions as partner questions arise and to disseminate these policy decisions through the periodic release of revised program documents to ensure consistent application of the program requirements.
